********************************************************************************
This project contains the code tu run and evaluate PCM, a parallel
content-based matching algorithm designed to efficiently run on multi-core
CPUs and on CUDA Mutiple- GPUs .


Download and expand CCM.tar.gz
make all to compile
make clean to remove all compiled objects
./CCM to run

********************************************************************************

Detailed descriptions and evaluations of CCM and OCM can be found in the
following papers:

Only Working Algo is 1 .therefore to run the program run using
./CCM 1
